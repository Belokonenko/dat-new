                by mail in an online store from Ukraine, a parcel with the order
                arrives at the client's post office. Employees of the post
                office/transport company must send him an alert and/or SMS
                message about the receipt of the parcel, so you need to monitor
                your postal box. Very often, messages are lost, so based on the
                approximate date of arrival of the parcel, inquire at the post
                office about the parcel yourself. It must be received within 5
                days from the day of arrival, after which the parcel is returned
                to the online store.

                When receiving an order with seeds, etc. goods, carefully
                inspect the parcel for the integrity of the packaging. In case
                of violation of the integrity of the packaging and/or missing
                part of the order and/or damage to the product, in the presence
                of an employee of the transport company or PJSC "Ukrposhta"
                conduct an inspection of the contents of the parcel, compare it
                with the enclosed delivery invoice for the goods, certified by
                the signature of an employee of the UkrNasinnia online store. If
                necessary, draw up an "Inspection Report" in which the condition
                of the packaging and goods, the nature of the damage, must be
                reflected. After drawing up the Act, the client must immediately
                contact the Contact Center of the UkrNasinya online store and
                provide a copy of the act on product inspection. If the
                employees of the delivery service refuse you to conduct an
                inspection and draw up the Act, the customer has the right not
                to sign the goods and transport documents and not to pick up the
                order.The presence of the consignee's signature in the
                accompanying invoice means that the goods have been received and
                claims against the seller and the company that delivered the
                seeds, etc. there are no products.
