        <p>
            Means of plant protection are divided into four main types:
            mechanical, chemical, biological and agrotechnical. However, the
            most rational thing is their simultaneous, correct combination. The
            most common method is chemical. There are thousands of different
            types of chemical protection products. But they should not be
            confused, let alone combined with chemical fertilizers. The methods
            of their influence on plants are completely opposite.

        <p>
            It is necessary to know and distinguish chemical means of plant
            protection. After all, these drugs have a strictly defined object of
            influence (the causative agent of the disease, insect pests, a
            species or family of weeds).

        <p>
            Poisonous chemicals do not tolerate negligence. This is the type of
            drug that is not enough to simply dilute in water and spray plants
            with it. If pesticides are used incorrectly, they can harm you, the
            beneficial insects, and the crop.
